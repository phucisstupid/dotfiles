## The philosophy my dotfiles

- The result of thousands of hours spent simplifying configs, removing clutter, and digging through documentation
- Clean and declarative, **no duplicated defaults**.
- Fully structured for effortless updates, no hard-coded configs.
- No personal preferences included — customize in [config.nix](./config.nix).
